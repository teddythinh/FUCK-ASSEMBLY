# MY FUCKING ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE 

## Introduction:
This repository contains some of my homework assignments. If you don't understand, please don't touch. (I don't either üò≠üò≠üò≠.)
Because I no longer use assembly language for any further reason, I am no longer contributing to this repository.

**NOTE: I'm not sure whether my program is working properly, perhaps there are a few logical bugs, please feel free to contact me or open issues to fix these bugs. Thank you so much!**

PLEASE GIVE MY CREDIT OR MENTION ME `@teddythinh` WHEN USING. THANKS !‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
